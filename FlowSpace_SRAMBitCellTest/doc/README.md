# Single SRAM cell test structures

This is design for test structures to measure metric on a single SRAM cell. It is part of the SRAM compiler development in the FlowSpace project.

The documentation is divided in a few chapters:

* [SP6T](SRAMCellSP6T.html) and [DP8T](SRAMCellDP8T.html) cell simulation output
* [Test prodecure](Short_TestProc_Description.md): short description of the circuit and the measurements to be done on the single SRAM test structure
* [Structures overview](TestStructures_table.md): table with all the variations present on the test structure
* [dense SRAM rules](SRAM_rules_overview.md): overview of denser rules used for the SRAM structures
* [Pin out](padframe_pinouts.md): pin-out of the test structures on the probe card pad frame.
