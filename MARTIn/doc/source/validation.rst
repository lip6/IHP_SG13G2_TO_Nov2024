Validation of MARTIn chip
#################################

The validation process of the design was done utilizing testbenches for the filter that contains \ 
the median finding algorithm and a testbench for the shift register.

These testbenches were utilized after creating the desing in System verilog and after the layout, using \
the 6_final.v netlist and annotating with the SDF file generated by OpenSTA.

Lastly DRC and LVS tests were done.
