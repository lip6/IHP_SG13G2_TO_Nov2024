when using the IO library ihp-sg13g2/libs.ref/sg13g2_io/gds/sg13g2_io.gds i couldent get LVS with ihp-sg13g2/libs.ref/sg13g2_io/cdl/sg13g2_io.cdl run error free. not even sg13g2_IOPadIn was working. so its not possibe for me to get LVS running - if i use sg13g2_io.gds...

so i tried to LVS via the KLayouts Netist Browser...
