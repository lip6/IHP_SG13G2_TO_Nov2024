Specification of the CryoChip
###################################


Understanding the operation of electronic circuits applied in low-temperature environments is crucial for the implementation of systems aimed at quantum computing. This is because, in cryogenic environments, material properties and device behavior can differ significantly from those observed at conventional temperatures.

To characterize circuits at both conventional and cryogenic temperatures, a chip was developed to test the behavior of the designs proposed below.

-	8 NMOS transistors (various sizes)
-	8 PMOS transistors (various sizes)
-	A structure with 6 NMOS and 6 PMOS transistors for characterization measurements
-	1 inverter
-	3 resistivity measurement devices based on the Van der Pauw structure
